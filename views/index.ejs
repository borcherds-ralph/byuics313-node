    <h2>This site is created by Ralph Borcherds for BYU-Idaho CS-313 class.</h2>
    <p>The technology used for this site is Node.js, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and PostgreSQL. This is an example of what can be done with Node.js. Heroku only supports the PostgreSQL database on their system, that is why it is being used.  Any database back-end may be used.</p>
